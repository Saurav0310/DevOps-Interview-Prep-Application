## Answer
There are mainly two types of CI/CD pipelines: linear and branching.  A linear pipeline is like an assembly line; code goes through each step sequentially â€“ build, test, deploy.  It's simple and easy to understand, perfect for smaller projects with straightforward deployments.  Imagine a website updating its content; a linear pipeline would build the new content, test it for errors, and then push it live.



Branching pipelines are more complex, allowing for parallel processing and different deployment paths.  This is useful for larger projects with multiple environments (like development, testing, and production) or when you need to handle feature flags or A/B testing.  Think of a large software company releasing a new app feature; a branching pipeline might test the feature on a small user group before a full release.



Choosing the right pipeline depends on your project's size and complexity.  Linear pipelines are great for simplicity, while branching pipelines offer more flexibility and control for larger, more intricate
